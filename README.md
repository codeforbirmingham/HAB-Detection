# HAB-Detection

HAB-Detection will be a mobile application that allows users to take pictures of potential Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB)
observed  that have been observed and submit a report of the sighting. It will aid users in describing their
observations by asking series of questions about the HAB, and the application will generate information about the location
of the sighting (e.g. name of water body, proximity to water treatment facility, etc) using GPS features of
users’ smart phones. The application will also guide users through the EPA's required submission process.

## What is a HAB?

A HAB is [an algal bloom that causes negative impacts to other organisms via production of natural toxins, mechanical
damage to other organisms, or by other means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmful_algal_bloom#Harmful_algal_blooms). 
They're extremely detrimental to the environment. HABs are associated with the poisoning of aquatic life which can harm 
humans during consumption.

## Code for Birmingham & Code for America

Code for Birmingham is one faction of the much larger organization Code for America. The organization was created to 
bring communities and governments into the 21st century. It has 41 current chapters and is rapidly exploding both in the
US and internationally. The success in this model lies in the fact that it is organized just like the web: it's an open
network of people who communicate from city to city, and now country to country, and build on ideas and projects
previously started in other locations.
